# About:

This project was created to put into practice many of the modern angular dev practices like routers, observables, Input and Output components, services, lazy loading, modules and more.

If you are looking for this technology and want too see some code in action, this might be a good start. I'm trying to put in as many comments as possible to make the code as simple for newbies, like i was a while ago.

-- NEVER FORGET TO SEE THE OFFICIAL DOC'S ON THE LINK (https://angular.io/) --

Below we have some Angular automotive reviews.
